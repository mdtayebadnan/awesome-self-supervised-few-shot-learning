##  What is Few-Shot Learning?
Few-shot learning is a type of machine learning that focuses on the problem of learning new concepts or tasks from only a small number of examples or data points. In other words, it is a technique for training models that can quickly adapt to new, previously unseen data with minimal training data. The inspiration for few-shot learning comes from the strong reasoning and analytical abilities of humans, and its application is commonly found in edge computing environments.
